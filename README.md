Here is the simplest Spotify winforms app I could make.

It is possibly possible to simplify it further.

To get it to run simply add your client ID and secret.

To make it from scratch you will need to add the models folder and classes. 

I hate reading instrcutions so I got the models by trial and error, you could do it better by reading the Spotify instructions.

Any problems or if you fancy offering me jobs or wine let me know mgrowe888@gmail.com
